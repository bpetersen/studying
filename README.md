# Open Data Structures in Go

This repo contains my implementation work as I study _Open Data Structures_ by Pat Morin, using Go as the implementation language.

It's not a production project, just a way for me to deepen my understanding of low-level data structures while building fluency in Go.

## Why?

I work mostly in distributed systems and backend platform engineering, and I'm currently sharpening my Go skills to contribute more effectively in environments like Kubernetes and cloud-native microservices.

## What's inside

- Algorithms: basic stuff here. Just getting the hang of Golang.
- OpenDataStructures: implementations as I'm learning about them in the textbook. For example (arraydeque, arraylist, binarytree, etc.).

## Example

- `make test` from the ./OpenDataStructures folder.
- `make tw` to start tests and watch for changes. Great for the TDD workflow.
